## Overview

This is my first foray into HTML/CSS and frontend in general. The whole thing isn't terribly complex, but it certainly requires a lot of practice. The experience is truly the pinnacle here and the feeling comes at the fingertips of the frontend developer. The Frontend Mentor platform provides a set of decent challenges. I have yet to explore their social component.

## My process

Furious googling, opening MDN Web Docs continuously, tons of tabs and sleepless night. I am sure it gets better with the time.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Flexbox was a new concept for me. The practice of CSS structure was nice. 

### Continued development

The shadows are really hard to do, and I still haven't figured out the soft shadow that the example has.

### Useful resources

- [CSS @ MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - I must have about 15 tabs still open with this.
- [Flexbox @ Malven](https://flexbox.malven.co/) - A really nice cheatsheet for Flexbox attributes.
